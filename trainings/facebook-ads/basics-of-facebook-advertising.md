Find people similar to your best customers:

**How It Works:**

2. Choose a location
3. Select audience size (1%-10%)

**1% Lookalike** = Most similar to your source
**10% Lookalike** = Broader but less similar

**Best Practices:**
- Use your best customers as source
- Start with 1%-2% lookalikes
- Test different source audiences
- Update source lists regularly

## Budgeting and Bidding

**Industry Averages** (vary widely):

### Budget Allocation Strategy

**Testing Phase** (Week 1-2):
