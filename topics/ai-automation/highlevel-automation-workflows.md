  - Experience: Beginner / Intermediate / Advanced
  - Barriers: Time / Motivation / Injury / Cost
  - Preferences: Group classes / Personal training / Hybrid
```

#### Dynamic Content Delivery (14-Day Sequence)

- AI-generated welcome email personalized to their goal
- Example: "Sarah, Your Path to Weight Loss Success Starts Here"
- Include relevant success story (AI selects from database)

**Day 2: Educational Content**
- AI selects article/video based on their primary interest

**Day 3: Social Proof**
- AI-curated testimonial matching their profile
- Local success story (same city/age group if available)
