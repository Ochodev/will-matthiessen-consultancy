### Pricing Strategies

#### Service Pricing Models

**Retainer Model** (Recommended for most clients):
- **Pros**: Predictable revenue, ongoing relationship, compound results
- **Cons**: Client commitment required, monthly accountability
- **Best For**: Most clients seeking ongoing marketing support

**Project-Based Pricing**:
- **Pros**: Defined scope, clear deliverables, works for specific initiatives
- **Cons**: Stop-start relationship, harder to show long-term results
- **Best For**: One-time projects, specific campaign launches

**Performance-Based Pricing**:
- **Pros**: Aligns incentives, attractive to clients
- **Cons**: Risk for agency, external factors impact results
- **Best For**: E-commerce with clear attribution, high-trust relationships

**Hybrid Model**:
- Base retainer + performance bonuses
- Project fee + ongoing support retainer
- Setup fee + monthly management

#### Pricing Calculator

**Cost-Plus Pricing Model**:
```
Monthly Retainer Calculation:

Internal Costs:
├── Labor (hours × hourly rate): $X,XXX
├── Tools and software: $XXX
├── Ad spend management (if applicable): $XXX
└── Overhead allocation: $XXX
Total Direct Costs: $X,XXX

Margin:
└── Target margin (30-50%): $XXX

Recommended Client Price: $X,XXX/month
```

**Value-Based Pricing Considerations**:
- What is the value of a new customer to the client?
- How many new customers can we generate?
- What is the ROI potential?
- What would they pay for that result?

**Example**:
```
Client: HVAC company
Average job value: $3,000
Target: 10 new customers per month
Monthly value generated: $30,000
Our fee: $3,000/month (10% of value)
Client ROI: 10:1 (excellent)
```

2. **Address**: [Handle the real objection revealed]

2. **Evidence**: "Let me share a story about [similar client]..." [case study]
3. **Systematic**: "The difference is having a systematic, strategic approach rather than random tactics."
4. **Risk Reversal**: "That's why we start with [low-risk entry point] so you can see results before fully committing."

**"Can you guarantee results?"**

**Response Framework**:
1. **Honest**: "I can't guarantee specific numbers because there are variables outside our control - your sales follow-up, your product fit, market conditions..."
2. **Commit**: "What I can guarantee is our process, our effort, and our expertise. We've helped [X] businesses in your industry achieve [general results]."
3. **Track Record**: "Here's what we've accomplished with similar clients..." [show proof]
