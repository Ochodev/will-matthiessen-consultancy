## CRM Strategy and Best Practices

### Lead Management Strategy

**Lead Source Tracking**:
- Capture and track every lead source
- Use UTM parameters in URLs
- Tag contacts with source upon entry

- **Target**: Contact new leads within 5 minutes
- **Why**: 100x more likely to connect
- **Implementation**:
  - Instant notifications to sales team
  - Auto-responses to set expectations
  - Round-robin assignment for fair distribution
  - Escalation if no response in 10 minutes

**Lead Qualification**:
- Define your ideal customer profile
- Create qualification questions

### Sales Process Optimization

**Pipeline Management Best Practices**:

   - Assign realistic probability to each stage
   - Track win rates by stage and source

   - Correlate activity with win rate
   - Set minimum activity standards

4. **Learn from losses**: Document why deals are lost

### Communication Centralization

**Unified Inbox Benefits**:
- All conversations in one place (email, SMS, Facebook, Instagram)
- Full contact history visible

3. **Set SLAs**: Define expected response times
4. **Monitor daily**: Check inbox multiple times per day
5. **Mobile access**: Use mobile app for on-the-go responses
